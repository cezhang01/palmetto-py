# palmetto-py
Python interface for [Palmetto](https://github.com/AKSW/Palmetto)

## How to use
First install palmettopy from the pipy:
```
pip install palmettopy
```

Then you can include it into your application and get coherence for a list of words as follows:
```
from palmettopy.palmetto import Palmetto
palmetto = Palmetto()
words = ["cake", "apple", "banana", "cherry", "chocolate"]
palmetto.get_coherence(words)
```

By default, this interface uses "cv" coherence type (the best performing according to the publication [1]). 
The coherence type can be customized as follows:
```
from palmettopy.palmetto import Palmetto
palmetto = Palmetto()
words = ["cake", "apple", "banana", "cherry", "chocolate"]
palmetto.get_coherence(words, coherence_type="cv")
```
The available coherence types are "ca", "cp", "cv", "npmi", "uci", and "umass".

The default endpoint is run by AKSW research group [2]. If you want to run your own endpoint, you can customize the interface as follows:
```
from palmettopy.palmetto import Palmetto
palmetto = Palmetto("http://example.com/myownendpoint")
words = ["cake", "apple", "banana", "cherry", "chocolate"]
palmetto.get_coherence(words, coherence_type="cv")
```
